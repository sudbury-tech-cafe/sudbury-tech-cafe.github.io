#### Sudbury Tech Cafe

Come for the code.. stay for the commit confessions.

Sudbury Tech Cafe (STC) is a space for cross-disciplinary tech professionals where real exchange of ideas, tools, failures, and innovation can happen amongst peers who've already put in years.

Gathering local tech professionals who've outgrown beginner talks and want more than lectures for students. 

We co-lead sessions, share real-world technical stories, and push each other forward. Think of it as a hacker community (in the MIT sense) for the technically curious, professionally seasoned, and community-minded.
