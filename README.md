# Sudbury Tech Cafe

#### Come for the code.. stay for the commit confessions.


Sudbury Tech Cafe (STC) is a space for cross-disciplinary tech professionals where real exchange of ideas, tools, failures, and innovation can happen amongst peers who've already put in years.

A local community where tech professionals who've outgrown beginner talks and want more than lectures for students. We co-lead sessions, share real-world technical stories, and push each other forward. Think of it as a community for the technically curious, professionally seasoned, and community-minded.


## Format:
